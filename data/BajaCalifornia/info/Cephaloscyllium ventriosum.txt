The swell shark (Cephaloscyllium ventriosum) is a catshark in the family Scyliorhinidae. It is found in the subtropical eastern Pacific Ocean between central California and to southern Mexico, with an additional population off the coast of Chile. As a defense, the swell shark is able to expand to approximately double its regular size by swallowing water.
