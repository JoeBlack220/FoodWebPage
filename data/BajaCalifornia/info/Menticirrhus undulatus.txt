The California corbina (Menticirrhus undulatus) is marine demersal fish in the croaker family.California corbina are uniformly grey in color with some iridescence and have an elongated and slightly compressed body shape in comparison to other croakers. Like all members of the genus Menticirrhus, the California corbina lacks a swim bladder and is unable to produce a croaking sound. It is believed that the loss of the swim bladder evolved to facilitate living in a turbulent environment.
