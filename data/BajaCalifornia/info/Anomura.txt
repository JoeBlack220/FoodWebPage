Anomura is a group of decapod crustaceans, including hermit crabs and others. Although the names of many anomurans includes the word crab, all true crabs are in the sister group to the Anomura, the Brachyura. The group has been moulded by several instances of carcinisation the development of a crab-like body form. Thus, the king crabs , porcelain crabs and hairy stone crab are all separate instances of carcinisation.
