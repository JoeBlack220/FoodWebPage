Lopholithodes is a genus of king crab. It includes Lopholithodes foraminatus and Lopholithodes mandtii, the Puget Sound king crab. The brown box crab, Lopholithodes foraminatus, is a king crab that lives from Kodiak Island, Alaska to San Diego, California. It often lies buried in the sediment, and two foramens in the chelipeds allow water into the gill chamber for respiration.
