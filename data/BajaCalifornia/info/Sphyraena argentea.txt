Sphyraena argentea (also known as Pacific barracuda, California barracuda, and silver barracuda) is a predatory fish found in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The Pacific barracuda has an elongated cylinder shape body. They are slender and have a long pointy snout. They are of brownish-bluish color on their front sides. They are distinct from other Barracudas due to their silvery shiny backsides, small scales, and the lack of bars or spots on their body. Known for their large mouths full of sharp teeth and fang-like structures, the Pacific Barracuda are predatory fish with aggressive characteristics.
