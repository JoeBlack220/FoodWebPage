Sphyraena argentea is a predatory fish found in the northeast Pacific Ocean. The Pacific barracuda has an elongated cylinder shape body. They are slender and have a long pointy snout. They are of brownish-bluish color on their front sides. They are distinct from other Barracudas due to their silvery shiny backsides, small scales, and the lack of bars or spots on their body.
