The Rainbow surfperch (Hypsurus caryi) or Rainbow seaperch is a species of surfperch found along the Pacific coast of North America from Cape Mendocino, California to northern Baja California, Mexico. This species prefers rocky shores over sandy ones, and is never found in the surf, preferring the edges of kelp forests down to depths of about 40 metres (130 ft). This species grows to a length of 30 centimetres (12 in) TL. This species is the only known member of its genus.[1] The specific name name honours Thomas Cary (1824-1888), a business man and amateur naturalist who was also the brother-in-law of Louis Agassiz who procured specimens that confrmed that this spceies was viviparous.
