Kathetostoma is a genus of bony fish from the family Uranoscopidae, the stargazers. They are demersal predators which are found in the western Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, with most species around Australia and New Zealand. They have a naked body with a head which has a quadrilateral cross section with the eyes directed upward. These have a small, bony orbital rim and are separated by a scaleless rectangular space. The mouth is armed with a number of large canines which sit among smaller canines. The chin is smoothly curved and the lips have short ridge-like crenulations.
