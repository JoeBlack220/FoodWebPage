Balistes polylepis or Finescale triggerfish is a species of Balistes found in the Pacific Coast from San Francisco down to Callao, Peru and the Galapagos. Balistes is a genus of triggerfish. Triggerfishes are about 40 species of often brightly colored fish of the family Balistidae. Often marked by lines and spots, they inhabit tropical and subtropical oceans throughout the world, with the greatest species richness in the Indo-Pacific. Most are found in relatively shallow, coastal habitats, especially at coral reefs, but a few, such as the oceanic triggerfish (Canthidermis maculata), are pelagic.
