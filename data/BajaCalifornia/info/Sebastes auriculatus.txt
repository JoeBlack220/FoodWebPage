The brown rockfish (Sebastes auriculatus), whose other names include brown seaperch, chocolate bass, brown bass, and brown bomber, is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Sebastidae. The brown rockfish has a body colored in various shades of brown. In this species, the background color is overlaid with dark-brown, red-brown, or blackish mottling. The rear area of the gill cover has a prominent dark patch which probably inspired its Latin name auriculatus, meaning "eared". This blotch may become faint in larger specimens. Stripes of red-brown, brown, or orange radiate back from the upper jaw and eyes.
