Haemulidae is a family of fishes in the order Perciformes known commonly as grunts. There are about 133 species in 19 genera. These fish are found in tropical fresh, brackish, and salt waters around the world. They are bottom-feeding predators, and named for their ability to produce sound by grinding their teeth.
