The thornback guitarfish is a species of ray in the family Platyrhinidae, and the only member of its genus. Despite its name and appearance, it is more closely related to stingrays than to true guitarfishes of the family Rhinobatidae. This species ranges from Tomales Bay to the Gulf of California, generally in inshore waters no deeper than 6 m. It can be found on or buried in sand or mud, or in and near kelp beds.
