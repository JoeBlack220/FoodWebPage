Zooplankton are heterotrophic plankton . Plankton are organisms drifting in oceans, seas, and bodies of fresh water. Individual zooplankton are usually microscopic, but some are larger and visible to the naked eye.Zooplankton is a categorization spanning a range of organism sizes including small protozoans and large metazoans. It includes holoplanktonic organisms whose complete life cycle lies within the plankton, as well as meroplanktonic organisms that spend part of their lives in the plankton before graduating to either the nekton or a sessile, benthic existence.
