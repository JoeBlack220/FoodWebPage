Paralabrax clathratus, the kelp bass, sometimes referred to as the Calico bass, is a species of marine fish found in the eastern North Pacific Ocean from Baja California, Mexico, to Washington, United States. As suggested by its common name, it is typically associated with kelp beds, but may also be found in rocky areas or near hard structures. It prefers relatively shallow water, but may occur as deep as 165 ft.
