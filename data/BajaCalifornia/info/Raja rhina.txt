Beringraja rhina, commonly known as the longnose skate, is a species of skate in the family Rajidae from the northeast Pacific. It is found from the eastern Bering Sea and Alaska to Baja California and the Gulf of California. The longnose skate is found at depths of 9¨C1,069 m (30¨C3,507 ft) and often deeper than the big skate. The longnose skate has only recently been associated with the genus Beringraja, having been previously included in Raja until genetic evidence supported reclassification. This issue has not be completely resolved and the scientific name "Raja rhina" is still in widespread use.
