Oeconesus is of family Caddisfly. The caddisflies, or order Trichoptera, are a group of insects with aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults. Integripalpian larvae construct a portable casing to protect themselves as they move around looking for food, while Annulipalpian larvae make themselves a fixed retreat in which they remain, waiting for food to come to them.
