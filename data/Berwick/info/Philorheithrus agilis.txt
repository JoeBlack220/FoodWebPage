Philorheithrus agilis larvae construct robust cases made of coarse sand grains. Each of the three thoracic segments have hard plates. The fore legs and mid legs are raptorial. Philorheithrus larvae are most common in fast flowing, cold water streams, particularly in mountainous areas. They are predators of other stream invertebrates.
