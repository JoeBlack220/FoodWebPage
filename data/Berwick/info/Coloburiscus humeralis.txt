Coloburiscus humeralis is a medium-sized, slightly flat nymph. The mouthparts, which sits at the base of the head are large and adapted to filter food particles from the water. The nymphs have cactus-like gills covering the top of the abdomen. The front and mid legs are very hairy and they trap drifting food particles consisting of plant fragments and small invertebrates.
