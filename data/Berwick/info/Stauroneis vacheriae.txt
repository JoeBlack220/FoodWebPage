Stauroneis vacheriae has naviculoid and mostly solitary cells with two chloroplasts, one on each side of the cell against the cingulum. Valves range from almost linear to lanceolate to elliptic-lanceolate. The central area is a prominent transverse fascia, known as a ¡°stauros¡±. The central fascia typically extends to the valve margins, where one to several short striae may be present.
