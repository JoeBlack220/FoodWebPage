Yellow Mayfly, Ameletopsis perscitus, are aquatic insects belonging to the order Ephemeroptera. Mayflies are hemimetabolous. They are unique among insects in that they moult one more time after acquiring functional wings; this last-but-one winged instar usually lives a very short time and is known as a subimago, or to fly fishermen as a dun. Mayflies at the subimago stage are a favourite food of many fish, and many fishing flies are modelled to resemble them.
