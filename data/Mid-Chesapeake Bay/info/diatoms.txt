Diatoms are a major group of algae,specifically microalgae, found in the oceans, waterways and soils of the world. Diatoms are unicellular: they occur either as solitary cells or in colonies, which can take the shape of ribbons, fans, zigzags, or stars. Individual cells range in size from 2 to 200 micrometers.
