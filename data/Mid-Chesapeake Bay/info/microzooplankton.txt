Microzooplankton are a group of heterotrophic and mixotrophic planktonic organisms between 20 and 200 um in size. Important contributors to the group are phagotrophic protists such as flagellates, dinoflagellates, ciliates, acantharids, radiolarians, foraminiferans, etc, and metazoans such as copepod nauplii, rotiferans and meroplanktonic larvae, among others.
