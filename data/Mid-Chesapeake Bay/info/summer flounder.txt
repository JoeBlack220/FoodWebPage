The summer flounder is a marine flatfish that is found in the Atlantic Ocean off the East Coast of the United States and Canada. It is especially abundant in waters from North Carolina to Massachusetts.Paralichthys dentatus, also called a fluke, is a member of the large-tooth flounder family Paralichthyidae. There are typically 5 to 14 ocellated spots on the body. Like most members of the left-eye flounders, they can change the color and pattern of their dark side to match the surrounding bottom, and are also capable of rapidly burrowing into muddy or sandy bottoms.
