Catatropis johnstoni is a fluke from the United States. It was first described in 1956 by Martin, who had found cercariae released by the snail Cerithidea californica in southwestern California. When the cercaria were fed into chickens , they developed into mature worms; Martin speculated that the natural host was a waterbird.
