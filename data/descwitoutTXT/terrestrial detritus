In biology, detritus is dead organic material, as opposed to living organisms or inorganic matter. However, what specifically is included as detritus varies according to different researchers, with some restricting the term to only non-living particulate organic matter (POM), while others also include dissolved organic matter (DOM), and yet others include the associated microbial decomposers.
