Beetles are a group of insects that form the order Coleoptera. Their front pair of wings are hardened into wing-cases, elytra, distinguishing them from most other insects. Beetles typically have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though some such as the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra.
