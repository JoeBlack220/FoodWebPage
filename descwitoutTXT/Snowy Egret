The snowy egret (Egretta thula) is a small white heron. The genus name comes from the Proven√ßal French for the little egret aigrette, a diminutive of aigron, "heron". The species name thula is the Araucano for the Black-necked Swan, applied to this species in error by Chilean naturalist Juan Ignacio Molina in 1782.
