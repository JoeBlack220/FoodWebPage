Pachygrapsus crassipes, known as the striped shore crab or lined shore crab A.K.A. "crab", is a small crab found on rocky and hard-mud shores of the west coast of North to Central America and in the western Pacific in Korea and Japan. In North America, it's range spans from Vancouver Island to Baja California, Mexico. The Asiatic population appears to not be invasive but endemic, resulting from a divergence estimated between 0.8 and 1.2 Mya.
